      <h1> About me </h1>
        <p>
        I'm a PhD student at <a href="https://epfl.ch" target="_blank">EPFL</a> in the <a href="https://hexhive.epfl.ch" target="_blank">Hexhive</a> group under supervision from <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://nebelwelt.net/" target="_blank">Prof. Mathias Payer</a>. I'm interested in all things fuzzing and system security.

        In the past, I had the chance to work as a software engineer at <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://compassion.ch" target="_blank">Compassion Suisse</a> and <a href="https://digger.ch" target="_blank">Fondation Digger</a> as part of my civil service.

        During my education, I had the chance to spend a year abroad in Pittsburgh and discover the United States. I also spent 4 years studying in the German part of Switzerland where I experienced a new culture and learned a <a rel="noreferrer" href="http://www.eldrid.ch/swgerman.htm" target="_blank">funny language</a>.

        I grew up in the beautiful 
        <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.myvalleedejoux.ch" target="_blank">Vall√©e de Joux</a>
        where I had the chance to experiment with the joy of the outdoors, learning to ski, sleep on frozen lakes, and make <em>true</em> wood fires.

        . As all <em>real</em> swiss citizen, I eat way too much chocolate and try to compensate by conquering mountains tops.

        <p>
        As a follower of Jesus-Christ, I love to talk about the interaction between faith, science, and our own life be it at the <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://gbeu.ch/" target="_blank">Groupes Bibliques Universitaires</a>, in my local <a rel="noopener" href="https://interjeunes.net" target="_blank">youth group</a>, or with other friends.
